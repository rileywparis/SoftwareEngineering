I find this repo very interesting because it aids the process of interfacing with the can bus of a BMW. This is something I have dabbled with in the past with my BMWs.

2. https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper
This is very fascinating as it provides all of the offsets/memory addresses for CS:GO used to create game hacks. I have used this before when I used to be interested in game hacking.

3. https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite
This repo seems like it could be useful for creating apps or web pages that require networking of some sort. This would be much easier to use than creating a server from scratch I am sure.

4. https://github.com/Merubokkusu/discord-spam-bots
I think this one seemed interesting, however, it seems like it would not be usable without getting banned. The thought of trying it on a backup account in a friend's server seems interesting though.

5. https://github.com/github/gitignore
Important when committing files to a repository to exclude certain files from those changes.
